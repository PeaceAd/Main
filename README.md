# 📌 pridict.sol

`pridict.sol` is a Solidity smart contract built for decentralized prediction functionalities. It enables users to create, participate in, and resolve prediction-based events securely on the blockchain.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Event Creation** – Define prediction markets with customizable parameters.
* **Participation** – Users can place predictions with specified stakes.
* **Resolution** – Events can be resolved by authorized entities or via oracles.
* **Transparency** – All predictions and results are publicly verifiable on-chain.
* **Security** – Written with Solidity best practices for safe handling of funds.

## 📜 Usage

### 1. Deploy Contract

* Deploy `pridict.sol` on Ethereum, BNB Chain, or any EVM-compatible blockchain.

### 2. Interact with Functions

* **`createPrediction()`** → Start a new prediction market.
* **`placeBet()`** → Place a bet on an outcome.
* **`resolveEvent()`** → Finalize the prediction result.
* **`withdrawWinnings()`** → Claim rewards if your prediction was correct.
